## Landscape:

What domain of the financial industry is the company in? What are the other major companies in this domain?What have been the major trends of this domain?

* Coinbase is a big financial company and as you might imagine it covers multiple domains from payments/remitences to investing and brokeraging. Its biggest competitors right now are Binance, Kraken, Huobi Global, Bitfinex, and Bittrex to name a few. Some of the major trends in this industry is that with the public increase in public interest in crypto more and more exchanges are coming into exsistence. This will lead to firms competing for customers by lowering their fees. Another trend in this space is increased pressure form world governments to regulate and monitor more closely potentially illegal transaction.


## Results and Recomendations

What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* The main metrics that coinbase and other exchanges are evaluated by are Verified Customers, Transaction Volume, Liquidity and also the number of currencies you can trade. Bitcoins Verified customers are above 56 million. Its quarterly Volume traded is 335 Billion dollars. Coinbases Assets on platform are more than $223 Billion dollars. In addition to these numbers Coinbase has had an IPO recently and it is currently valued at more than 53.5 Billion dollars. 

If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? 

* Coinbase is a massive financial technology business that has been operating for almost a decade at the cutting edge of finance and technology. The only recomendation that I could provide is from a customers point of view they should reduce their fees otherwise like the stockbrokerage business customers will opt for a cheaper solution.
